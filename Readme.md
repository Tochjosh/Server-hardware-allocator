## Description

## Getting Started

Getting started with this project is very simple, all you need is to have Git and Docker Engine installed on your machine. Then open up your terminal and run this command `git clone git@github.com:decadevs/Bouncer_API_TeamA_Python08.git` to clone the project repository.

Change directory into the project folder `cd bouncer-api` and build the base python image used for the project that was specified in **_dockerfile_** by running `docker build .` _Note the dot (.) at end of the command_.

Spin up other services needed for the project that are specified in **_docker-compose.yml_** file by running the command `docker-compose up`. At this moment, your project should be up and running with a warning that _you have unapplied migrations_.

Open up another terminal and run this command `docker-compose exec api python project/manage.py makemigrations` for creating new migrations based on the models defined and also run `docker compose exec api python project/manage.py migrate` to apply migrations.

In summary, these are the lists of commands to run in listed order, to start up the project.

```docker
1. git clone git@github.com:decadevs/Bouncer_API_TeamA_Python08.git
2. cd bouncer-api
3. docker build .
4. docker-compose up
5. docker-compose exec api python project/manage.py makemigrations
6. docker-compose exec api python project/manage.py migrate
```

## Running Tests

Currently, truthy tests has been provided in each of the application defined in the project, before running the tests with the following command make sure that your api service is up and running.

```docker
docker-compose exec api python project/manage.py testclear

```
